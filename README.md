# Refined-Storage
Project developed during the class Progamming Lab on the first year of my masters degree.

For warehouse owners and companies who want to improve their inventory management and efficiency, Refined Storage is a warehouse management system that benefits all warehouse owners.
An advanced warehouse management system could optimize the warehouse’s storage space, facilitate interactions with the customer, organize employee’s schedules and control their clock-in times. The system could also be capable of creating and storing product identifiers in a database and their respective location in the warehouse. Product transfers and purchase orders could easily be overseen by a regular employee. All these features can dramatically improve efficiency and avoid wasting time and manpower.

There is information missing since i couldn´t upload and copy everything from the previous repository on gitlab.
